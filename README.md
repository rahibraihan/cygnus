Note: Choosing an appropriate step size is important for balancing accuracy and computational cost.
Tip: You can modify the test function or step sizes in the C++ code to experiment with different scenarios.


The error_plot.png shows how the numerical error decreases as the step size is reduced, demonstrating faster convergence for higher-order methods.
