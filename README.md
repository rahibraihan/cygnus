Higher-Order Methods and Richardson Extrapolation for Numerical Differentiation : 

This repository contains our **group assignment on numerical differentiation techniques**, exploring how different methods compare in terms of **accuracy and convergence**.
We implemented and compared various numerical differentiation methods to approximate derivatives of smooth functions.  
The main goal was to understand how **higher-order methods improve accuracy** and how **Richardson extrapolation reduces errors**.

## 📌 What We Did

### 1️ Second-Order Central Difference Method (O(h²))

#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

double f(double x) {
    return x * x;
}

int main() {
    double x = 2.0, h = 0.001;
    double derivative;

    derivative = (f(x + h) - f(x - h)) / (2 * h);

    printf("Approximate derivative: %lf\n", derivative);
    return 0;
}


### 2️ Fourth-Order Central Difference Method (O(h⁴))

**Formula:**
\[
f'(x) \approx \frac{-f(x+2h) + 8f(x+h) - 8f(x-h) + f(x-2h)}{12h}
\]

-> Error: **O(h⁴)**

---

### 3 Richardson Extrapolation

**Formula:**
\[
D_R = \frac{4D(h/2) - D(h)}{3}
\]

-> Improves accuracy without increasing computational complexity

---

### 4 Additional Analysis
-> Analyzed **errors**, **stability**, and **convergence behavior**
-> Generated **plots and tables** to visualize numerical results

---

## 🧪 Test Function

We used the following test function:

\[
f(x) = \sin(x)
\]

Exact derivative:

\[
f'(x) = \cos(x)
\]

-> Evaluation point: **x = 1.0**
-> Step sizes: **h = 0.1, 0.05, 0.025, **

## 💡 Key Insights

-> Higher-order methods significantly reduce truncation error  
-> Fourth-order schemes outperform second-order schemes  
-> Richardson extrapolation improves accuracy  
-> Choosing an appropriate step size is critical for numerical stability  


# cygnus
Note: Choosing an appropriate step size is important for balancing accuracy and computational cost.
Tip: You can modify the test function or step sizes in the C++ code to experiment with different scenarios.


The error_plot.png shows how the numerical error decreases as the step size is reduced, demonstrating faster convergence for higher-order methods.
