Higher-Order Methods and Richardson Extrapolation for Numerical Differentiation : 
This repository contains our group assignment on numerical differentiation techniques and exploring how different methods compare in terms of accuracy and convergence.
We implemented and compared various numerical differentiation methods to approximate derivatives of smooth functions. The main goal was to understand how higher order methods improve accuracy and how Richardson extrapolation can reduce errors.

What we did :
1. Implemented second-order central difference method (O(h²)) ​
            f'(x) ≈ [f(x+h) - f(x-h)] / (2h)
            Error: O(h²)
2. Implemented fourth-order central difference method (O(h⁴))
            f'(x) ≈ [-f(x+2h) + 8f(x+h) - 8f(x-h) + f(x-2h)] / (12h)
            Error: O(h⁴)
3. Applied Richardson extrapolation to improve accuracy
            D_R = [4D(h/2) - D(h)] / 3
4. Analyzed errors, stability, and convergence behavior
5. Generated plots and tables to visualize results

Test Function :
We used f(x) = sin(x) as 
our test function with the exact derivative f'(x) = cos(x). 
The derivative was evaluated at x = 1 using different step sizes (h = 0.1, 0.05, 0.025, ...).

System Requirements :
Compiler: C++ 
Visualization: Gnuplot
